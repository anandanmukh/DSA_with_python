## Assignment Statement
- Assign a value to a name
- eg i = 5
- Left hand side is a name
- Right hand side is an expression
- Operations in expression depend on type of value

## Numeric Values
- Numbers come in two flavours
- int: integers
- float: fractional numbers
- 178, -3, 2344532 are examples of integers
- 13.2, 0.4, -9.3 are examples of type float

## int vs float
- Why are these different types?
- Internally, a value is stored as a finite sequence of 0's and 1's(binary digits or bits)
- For an int, this sequence is read off as a binary number
- for a float, this sequence breaks up into a mantissa and exponent
- Like 6.022 * 10**24
